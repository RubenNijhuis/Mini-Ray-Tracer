ðŸŒˆ A small ray tracing project for the exercise "MiniRT"

[ Display nice img here]

## Quick Start 
```
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:RubenNijhuis/Mini-Ray-Tracer.git
$ make run
```

## Testing
Dependent on Criterion lib, install via brew and run make with the `CODAM=1` variable.

## Todo
[ ] - Setup a vector math lib  
[x] - Research unions  
[x] - Get objs from file  
    [x] - Setup object structs  

How do I fix?
File where order of elements is messy. It's easier to read the file if the order is "scene objects" "shapes" vs mix and match
