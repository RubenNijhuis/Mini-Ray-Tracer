# Mini Ray Tracer
ðŸŒˆ A small ray tracing project for the exercise "MiniRT"

## Quick Start 
```
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:RubenNijhuis/Mini-Ray-Tracer.git
$ make run
```

Some of the next steps could be changing the name of the project. Which you can do in the `General Variables` section of the Makefile.

## Notes

#### Submodules:
This project uses my personal libraries, in case you want to use your own I recommend learning some stuff about git submodules [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

However the `Makefile` specifically supports my project/library structure. This WILL be an issue if your library structure differs. Mine works like this.
